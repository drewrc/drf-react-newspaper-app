Upon opening the app, users are presented with a homepage that displays the latest published news stories from different categories such as business, politics, entertainment, sports, health, and more. The user can then select a category of their interest, and the app will display a list of articles from that particular category. 

1. set up a feature that allows the user to sort 
through articles by category - done
2. set up search bar/fetch request that allows the user to fetch specific categories of articles

Upon logging into the app, verified users can create new articles, edit their existing articles that are in the draft phase, and delete articles that have not been submitted for review. Once an article has been submitted for review, it cannot be edited or deleted by the user. The app should provide a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to manage their articles.
